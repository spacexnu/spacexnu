### 👨‍💻 Software Engineer | 20+ years coding | Real Security, Practical AI, Decentralized Systems

Started on a BBS running MS-DOS. Never stopped building.  
Today I design and ship systems that resist — scalable, secure, and censorship-resistant by default.

Self-taught. Low-level curious. Privacy defender.  
Not interested in hype. Only in code that survives the next wave.
