### 👨‍💻 Software Engineer | 20+ years coding | Real Security, Practical AI, Decentralized Systems

Started on a BBS running MS-DOS and never stopped building.
Today I design and ship systems that endure — scalable, secure, and censorship-resistant by default.

Self-taught, low-level curious, privacy defender.
Not chasing hype, only code that survives the next wave.

GPG-signed commits never lie.
